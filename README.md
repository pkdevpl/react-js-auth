# React JS Auth Boilerplate

## About

This repo is a starting point for apps requiring authentication in React JS. It uses functional components and can be customized with react-bootstrap and sass.

See working example here: https://pkdev-react-js-auth.web.app

You can use temporary e-mail provider like [temp-mail.org](https://temp-mail.org) if you wish not to provide your working e-mail address.
